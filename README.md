# Window Scripts
This is just a collection of scripts I use to move/filter comics/magazines/ebooks into my setup. I'm positive there are better scripts out there. This is just a backup for myself. Please use these at your own risk.

CBR2CBZ.bat = This will find cbr or rar files in that folder and convert them to cbz. Useful for comics

MoveFilesfromFolderandDeleteFolder.bat - Run this in a parent directory with a lot of subfolders and it will move every file out of that subfolder into the main folder and delete the subfolders. I use this for my magazines as they generally come in their own folder. Caution should be used with this script as there is no way to reverse what you've done.
